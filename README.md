# Tic-tac-toe

a Pok√©mon themed 2 players Tic-tac-toe game as part of the JS module of The Odin Project - [live preview](https://sarav929.github.io/tic-tac-toe/)  

I tried to build the game using a module pattern/IIFEs, as the main goal of this exercise was to try having as little global code as possible. It was a great project to also get confident with the concepts of closure and scope. As suggested in the instructions I created a functioning tic-tac-toe game on the console to get the game logic down first, then I started adding the HTML and CSS - I think this was a great approach and helped me break down the problem. 

In the end I created two IIFEs, one for the game board and another to control the game (initialize, handle player's turn and moves, check for game over and announce it). I also included a form to get users' input and create custom player objects with a factory function.
